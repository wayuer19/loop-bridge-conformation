# loop-bridge-conformation
the script is used for calculating the comformation of one polymer chain in ACP
loop-bridge.py is based on the distance between the center and end of the chains. 以链中点与末端的距离为判断标准

loop-bridge-theta.py is based on the included angle of the two vectors. 以向量夹角为判断标准。

details can be found in the paper: Sci China Chem, 2019, 62: 226–237.
